      <h3>Playing Badminton</h3>
      <p>
        Badminton is that sport everyone loves and will always come back to. I am not even that good but playing together with friends who are equally as bad is  so fun and it's always so chill among us.

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>
        I'm just like any other girl. I love a good romance book and place imposibly high standards when it comes to men. Just give me an ice chocolate with a perfect rom-com books and I would dissapear for hours.

      <h3>Driving</h3>
      <p>
        What can I say, I love to drive. I secretly hope to be an F1 driver one day. Tell no one but I'm still hoping there is a way to become one, who knows.

      <h3>Listening to music</h3>
      <p>
        I loveeee to find a good song and play the same song over and over until I get sick of it. And the cycle continues everytime I discover a new song. Hold me back please.

  <h2>Favorite Music</h2>
  <p>
    Music is a constant companion in my life. I turn to it when I need comfort,
    motivation, or a moment to reflect. Different songs help me express emotions
    that words sometimes cannot.

        <h2>Favorite Color — Cherry Red</h2>
        <p>
          Cherry red represents confidence, passion, and courage to me.
          It stands out boldly while still carrying warmth and emotion.
          This color reflects my personality and the energy I bring into
          my creative work and personal style.

        <h2>Favorite Videos</h2>
        <p>
          Watching videos of my loved ones gives me the motivation to move forward. It reminds me the smiles and laughter when everything seems to be dull. The people in the videos may have drifted apart, but the memories were real enough to be cherish.
